On a warm day, nothing beats a glass of cold brew. This method uses time rather than heat—coffee grounds steep in cold water for 12-24 hours, producing a drink that’s naturally sweet, low in acidity, and incredibly smooth. We love serving cold brew over ice, and it’s easy to make a big batch at home for the week ahead.

French press:Full-Bodied Flavour 
The French press is all about simplicity and depth. Coarse coffee grounds steep in hot water, then are separated by pressing down a mesh plunger. This method allows more of the coffee’s natural oils and fine particles to remain in your cup, resulting in a rich, full-bodied flavor. At Coffo, we recommend steeping for about four minutes for the perfect balance.

The Espresso Shot :Intense and Iconic
Espresso is the heart of our menu and the base for beloved drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos. At Coffo, we grind our beans fine and use high pressure to pull a rich, concentrated shot, topped with velvety crema. The result? A bold, complex flavor that wakes up the senses. If you want to recreate this at home, invest in a quality espresso machine and use fresh, finely ground beans for best results.

Aero Press:Versatile and Quick
Looking for a clean, nuanced cup? Pour over might be your method. This technique involves pouring hot water slowly and evenly over ground coffee, letting gravity do the work. Our baristas love pour over for its ability to highlight subtle flavors—think floral notes, citrus, or chocolate. Pro tip: Use a gooseneck kettle for steady pouring and experiment with water temperature to find your perfect brew.

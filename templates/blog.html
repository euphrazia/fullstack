On a warm day, nothing beats a glass of cold brew. This method uses time rather than heat—coffee grounds steep in cold water for 12-24 hours, producing a drink that’s naturally sweet, low in acidity, and incredibly smooth. We love serving cold brew over ice, and it’s easy to make a big batch at home for the week ahead.

French press:Full-Bodied Flavour 
The French press is all about simplicity and depth. Coarse coffee grounds steep in hot water, then are separated by pressing down a mesh plunger. This method allows more of the coffee’s natural oils and fine particles to remain in your cup, resulting in a rich, full-bodied flavor. At Coffo, we recommend steeping for about four minutes for the perfect balance.

The Espresso Shot :Intense and Iconic
Espresso is the heart of our menu and the base for beloved drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos. At Coffo, we grind our beans fine and use high pressure to pull a rich, concentrated shot, topped with velvety crema. The result? A bold, complex flavor that wakes up the senses. If you want to recreate this at home, invest in a quality espresso machine and use fresh, finely ground beans for best results.

Aero Press:Versatile and Quick
Looking for a clean, nuanced cup? Pour over might be your method. This technique involves pouring hot water slowly and evenly over ground coffee, letting gravity do the work. Our baristas love pour over for its ability to highlight subtle flavors—think floral notes, citrus, or chocolate. Pro tip: Use a gooseneck kettle for steady pouring and experiment with water temperature to find your perfect brew.

It starts with a bean
The journey to the best coffee begins with the beans. At Coffo, we carefully source our beans from sustainable farms around the world, focusing on quality, ethical practices, and unique flavor profiles. Whether it’s the chocolatey notes of a South American roast or the floral hints from African origins, each bean brings something special to your cup.

Art of Roasting
Roasting is where the true character of the coffee shines. Our expert roasters bring out the best in every bean, balancing acidity, sweetness, and body. We sample every batch, making sure the flavors are just right before it ever reaches your mug.

Precision in brewing
Great beans and roasting deserve great brewing. At Coffo, our baristas are passionate professionals, trained to bring out nuanced flavors in every cup. Whether you prefer the clarity of a pour over, the intensity of an espresso, or the refreshing smoothness of cold brew, we have the right technique to match your taste.

Freshness Matters 
The best coffee is always fresh. We grind our beans just before brewing and pay attention to water quality and temperature, ensuring each cup is vibrant and full of life.

Experience 
At Coffo, the best coffee is about more than what’s in your cup. It’s about relaxing in a cozy space, chatting with friends, or getting a friendly smile from your barista. The atmosphere we create is as important as the drink itself.
